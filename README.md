# Manager Readme
Hi, my name is Rick and welcome to the team. I wrote this document so that you can understand a little bit about me, about the way I work and what I expect from each member of the team.
 
## My Role

As a manager, my primary role is to develop the careers of each and every team member. To enhance their skills and experiences. To make them more marketable. It is then my responsibility to make the job exciting and worthwhile getting out of bed for.

I always describe my job as an umbrella holder. I hold an umbrella above the team to protect them from distractions and allow each team member to focus on what they do best.

## Expectations of the team

I expect everybody on the team to support an open and collaborative culture.

I expect everybody on the team to push themselves beyond their comfort zone and to push for innovative solutions in everything they do.

I expect everybody on the team to identify business value in each and everything they work on, and evaluate each day's activities to ensure time was spent in the best way possible.

I expect every team member to always have quality at the forefront of everything they do. All tasks should have metrics associated with them so we can evaluate the quality and ensure we are focused on improvement of ourselves, of our solutions and of the organisation.

I expect everybody on the team to not present problems and instead identify solutions. I will always be available to work through your proposed solutions to identify the best solution for a given problem.

I expect everybody on the team to know when they should escalate issues or when they should continue working on an issue.

I expect everybody on the team to show discipline in following the process. We will support an agile culture and constantly improve all aspects of the process. The whole team will participate in owning the process and expected to follow the process as we have it defined.

I expect everybody on the team to self-organize. As a team, we will succeed together and at times we'll fail together. While each team member will have skills that the team will rely on, no team member is just a title and everybody will be expected to go beyond their job titles and contribute to the overall team success. I expect everybody on the team to self-organize for the greater good of the team.

## 1:1s

I will always make myself available whenever you need to talk and will make sure I have a regularly scheduled catchup at least once per fortnight.

When we do meet, we will always use it to discuss career development and talk through any issues you are currently facing. While we may discuss current task progress it is not the goal of each meeting. So come prepared.

## Who Am I?

I am an extroverted introvert. I get positive energy out of personal interactions and public speaking, but I do need personal time to unwind.

On the Think Feel Know classification, I am a Knower. This means that I trust my intuition. I make quick judgements and fast decisions. I tune into the energy from other people. I am happy with silence. I get straight to the point. And I remain calm and relaxed.

During meetings, I will not be the first person to speak.Â I like to analyse the discussion before I open my mouth. This does not mean I am not giving 100% of my attention during a meeting.

I am terrible at remembering names when I meet people. This is something I continue to work on.

I believe in work/life balance and enjoy time with my family and friends outside work hours. I'm always available for emergencies and suggest texting or calling me should you need me for an emergency. Likewise, I expect every team member to also shut down and recharge outside work. When required we'll establish out of hours support that can be spread around the team.

I prefer communication to be via slack. Once a decision has been made it should be preserved in an email to the team and stakeholders.
